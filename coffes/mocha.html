    <h3>
        How to Make a Mocha at Home
    </h3>

    <p></p>

    <h3>While you might associate mocha coffee with those aforementioned cafes, making your own mocha at home is so much more fun—and it's pretty easy, too. Before you get started, read our best tips for making mocha at home. </h2>

    <p></p>

    <h1 >1. Use Fresh Coffee</h1>

    <p></p>

    <h3 >It's important to use freshly roasted beans to avoid a stale, burnt flavor. It takes a whole lot of chocolate and cream to hide the taste of coffee that’s gone bad. (Remember, coffee only has a two-week shelf life.)</h2>

    <p></p>

    <h1>2. Don't Skimp On Ingredients</h1>
   
    <p></p>

    <h3 >Save the cheap chocolate syrup for your ice cream. Your homemade mocha coffee should have the good stuff! We recommend anything from Seattle Chocolates and Joe Chocolate Co., both of of which can be found in our Chocolate Collection Gift Box. You might also like our Coffee + Chocolate Tasting Box, which features four freshly roasted coffees and four artisan chocolates. Upgrade to the Deluxe Coffee + Chocolate Tasting Box for eight coffee and chocolate pairings.</h2>

    <p></p>

    <h1 >3. Choose the Right Coffee for Your Taste</h1>

    <p></p>

    <ul>
        <li><h3>1. For a classic blend, try Cream and Sugar by Slate Coffee Roasters. This light roast is perfect for a mocha coffee. </h2></li>
        <li><h3>2. Want to make a salted mocha? Try a combination of Lighthouse’s Roaster’s Choice and Seattle Chocolate’s San Juan Sea Salt.</h2></li>
        <li><h3>3. If you’re dreaming about the holidays, Fonte’s Portofino Blend and Seattle Chocolate’s Mint Milk make a creamy cup that'll remind you of Christmas morning.</h2></li>
        <li><h3>4. Fundamental Coffee Company's Kenya Kirinyaga and Jcoco’s Cayenne Veracruz Orange make a velvety white mocha with a spicy kick.</h2></li>
    </ul>
